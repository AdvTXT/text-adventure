Short Term:
* come up with a data model and database schema
* convert existing game to information stored in a database
* write an installation script so you can run multiple instances of the game. this is like a "poor mans" save state.

Medium Term:
* add an inventory system in the game. rooms knows what stuff they have in them. when you pick up an item in a room it's added to your inventory. you can examine items in your inventory.
* develop a simple map system so you know where you are. only explored areas should be shown. bonus point for some kind of neat ASCII graphical thing-a-ma-jig.
* finish the current story so that there's a full game to play through. a nice simple storyline.

Long Term:
* state machine for world changes
* level editor
* add a real grammar for parsing commands
