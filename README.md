## About

This is a text game and engine that I am writing just for fun. I loved playing Kings Quest when I was a kid 
and text adventures harken back to those days for me.

I'm going to continue updating the data files so that the story gets bigger and bigger. But if you have an 
idea, feel free to contribute it. 

This project is all about fun so I'm always open to ideas.
